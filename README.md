# RoomRelease
This Webex Macro monitors the endpoint to confirm if a meeting has started, then subsequently checks if nobody shows up (via peoplePresence and peopleCount). In the event nobody shows up after a predetermined time - will release the room (in Exchange) and make it available for others to book.

Currently the release feature is in public beta so the following tsh (remotesupport) commands are required;
• <i>xcommand Macros Macro Accessmode Set Name: <name-of-macro> Internal: True</i><br>
• <i>xconf Macros Experimental: True</i><br>
